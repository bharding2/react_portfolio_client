## react_portfolio_client

#### this is the client portion of a react portfolio.  There are no tests and limited gulp handling at this point.  The gulp task will run a webpack build.  You will need the react_portfolio_server running to give the react portfolio client an api to hook up too.

* to get started, `npm i` and then `gulp` to install your dependencies and run your gulp task.  The only gulp task is a webpack build, which no need to do to bundle the react stuff.
* run `node server.js` to serve up those files so you can access your app at localhost.
